Introduction to Timeless Computing

The Evolution of Computing: A Double-Edged Sword

In recent decades, computing has undergone remarkable advancements,
transforming nearly every aspect of our lives. Today’s computers are
faster, more powerful, and capable of performing tasks that were
unimaginable just a few years ago. Yet, amidst this progress lies a
paradox: while we enjoy enhanced capabilities, we also face challenges
such as reduced responsiveness, increased complexity, and heightened
security risks. Moreover, the constant pressure to upgrade to the latest
technology can make modern computers feel more like masters than tools.

The Emergence of Timeless Computing

Timeless computing emerges as a response to these challenges, offering a
vision of computing that prioritizes longevity, simplicity, and
reliability. It seeks to create systems that remain useful for decades,
if not centuries, by focusing on timeless applications such as reading,
writing, mathematics, and automation.

Core Principles of Timeless Computing

1.  Durability: Designing hardware and software that can withstand the
    test of time, with components designed for longevity and ease of
    repair or replacement.

2.  Simplicity: Emphasizing intuitive interfaces and straightforward
    functionality to ensure systems are user-friendly and accessible to
    all skill levels.

3.  Modularity: Creating systems that allow for easy expansion and
    customization, enabling users to add new features without replacing
    the entire system.

4.  Security: Prioritizing security through simplicity to protect
    against vulnerabilities and ensure long-term reliability.

5.  Open: Promoting transparency and collaboration through open-source
    hardware and software, fostering trust, innovation, and community
    support.

Why Timeless Computing Matters

Timeless computing addresses the growing need for systems that are not
only reliable but also environmentally sustainable. By focusing on
durability and modularity, it reduces electronic waste and promotes a
culture of sustainability. Additionally, its emphasis on simplicity
makes it accessible to a broader audience, empowering users to take
control of their technology without feeling overwhelmed.

This introduction sets the stage for exploring the fundamentals of
computing, FPGA technology, and the Zeitlos SOC/OS in subsequent
chapters. Together, we will delve into how these elements contribute to
creating systems that are not just functional today but designed to
endure for generations.

Who Are We

Our Timeless Computing initiative began at Lone Dynamics Corporation, an
American R&D company. Its experimental hardware manufacturing division,
Machdyne, was spun out into a new independent company, Machdyne UG,
which is now focused on manufacturing timeless computers, modules and
tools.

The first draft of this book was written by a Benevolent Agent
instantiated at GRAI LLC, a subsidiary of Lone Dynamics. The book has
since been verified, edited and improved by the Machdyne community and
we welcome additional contributors.

The Machdyne community consists of dozens of people with interest in
Timeless Computing, FPGA computing and survival computing.

Why We’re Writing This Book

In an era where technology evolves at breakneck speed, modern computers
often become obsolete within a few years, burdened by increasing
complexity and resource demands. While advancements in computing power
have undeniably transformed our world, this relentless progress has also
led to systems that are harder to understand, less secure, and more
disposable. The Timeless Computing initiative seeks to address these
challenges by developing hardware and software designed for longevity,
usability, and adaptability.

This book is born from the vision of creating computing solutions that
transcend transient trends, offering devices that can remain relevant
and functional for decades or even centuries. Our goal is to provide
systems that are not only durable but also intuitive, secure, and
user-repairable, fostering a sense of control and independence for
users.

Electronics

What is Electricity?

Electricity is the phenomenon caused by the presence and flow of
electric charge. Key concepts include:

-   Voltage: The potential energy difference between two points in an
    electrical circuit, measured in volts.

-   Current: The rate at which electric charge flows through a
    conductor, measured in Amperes (A).

-   Resistance: The opposition to the flow of current, measured in Ohms
    (Ω).

Ohm’s Law

Ohm’s Law is a fundamental principle in electronics that describes the
relationship between three key electrical quantities: voltage, current,
and resistance.

Ohm’s Law states that in an ideal conductor, the electric current
flowing through it is directly proportional to the potential difference
(voltage) across its ends. Mathematically, Ohm’s Law can be expressed
as:

1.  Voltage (V) as a function of current and resistance: ( V = I R )

2.  Current (I) as a function of voltage and resistance: ( I =
    $\frac{V}{R}$ )

3.  Resistance (R) as a function of voltage and current: ( R =
    $\frac{V}{I}$ )

What is Electronics?

Electronics is the study and application of electrical components and
systems that process or control electrical energy. It involves the
design and operation of devices, circuits, and systems using active and
passive electronic components.

Key Components in Electronics

1.  Passive Components:

    -   Resistors: Resistors limit the flow of electricity in a circuit.

    -   Capacitors: Capacitors store electrical energy in an electric
        field.

    -   Inductors: Inductors store electrical energy in a magnetic
        field.

2.  Active Components:

    -   Transistors: Transistors are fundamental building blocks used to
        amplify or switch electronic signals.

    -   Diodes: Diodes allow current to flow in one direction only.

3.  Integrated Circuits (ICs):

    -   ICs are tiny chips that contain thousands of transistors and
        other components, enabling complex functions in a small package.

Representation of Digital Signals as Voltages

In digital systems, information is represented using binary (base-2)
numbers, where data is encoded as a series of bits (binary digits). Each
bit can have one of two values: 0 or 1. In the context of electricity,
these binary values are typically represented by specific voltage
levels.

For example:

-   A low voltage (e.g., 0 volts) might represent a binary 0.

-   A high voltage (e.g., 3.3 volts or 5 volts) might represent a binary
    1.

This method of representing data using two distinct voltage levels is
known as TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) signaling, though modern
systems often use lower voltages for power efficiency.

Example:

Imagine you’re sending a message over a communication line. Each
character in your message can be converted into binary code. For
instance, the letter ‘A’ might be represented by the binary 01000001. As
this data is transmitted, each bit (0 or 1) is sent as a corresponding
voltage:

-   0 → 0 volts

-   1 → 3.3 volts

At the receiving end, electronic circuits detect these voltage levels
and convert them back into binary data, which can then be interpreted as
the original message.

A Brief History of Electricity, Electronics, and Computers

Electricity

The story of electricity begins in ancient civilizations, where natural
phenomena like static electricity were observed. Around 600 BCE, Thales
of Miletus noted that rubbing amber could attract feathers—an early
observation of electrostatic effects. The word electron is derived from
the Greek word for amber, though the actual discovery of the electron as
a particle occurred much later.

In the 1st century CE, Hero of Alexandria invented the aeolipile, a
steam-powered device that demonstrated principles of converting thermal
energy into motion. While it didn’t lead directly to modern engines, it
is often cited as a conceptual ancestor.

In the 18th century, Luigi Galvani discovered bioelectricity, showing
how electricity could affect living tissues. Building on this,
Alessandro Volta developed the voltaic pile in 1800, the first true
battery capable of producing a steady electric current. Georg Simon Ohm
later formulated Ohm’s Law in 1827, establishing the mathematical
relationship between voltage, current, and resistance—foundational to
circuit theory.

Electronics

The 19th century brought profound developments in electromagnetism.
Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction, showing how a
changing magnetic field could generate an electric current. James Clerk
Maxwell later unified electricity and magnetism through a set of
equations that became the cornerstone of classical electromagnetism.

Nikola Tesla advanced electrical engineering with the development of
alternating current (AC) systems, which proved more efficient for power
transmission than direct current (DC). His work laid the groundwork for
modern electric power distribution.

In the early 20th century, modern electronics emerged. In 1904, John
Ambrose Fleming invented the thermionic valve (diode), and in 1906, Lee
De Forest introduced the triode, enabling signal amplification and
switching. The invention of the transistor at Bell Labs in 1947 by
William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain revolutionized
electronics by replacing bulky vacuum tubes. This paved the way for
miniaturized electronic components and the development of integrated
circuits.

Computers

The concept of computing began in the 19th century with Charles Babbage,
who designed the analytical engine—an early mechanical general-purpose
computer. Ada Lovelace, a mathematician and visionary, wrote algorithms
for the analytical engine and is considered the world’s first computer
programmer.

In 1936, Alan Turing introduced the concept of the Turing machine, a
theoretical model of computation that laid the foundations of computer
science.

World War II accelerated the development of practical computing
machines. In 1943, the British-built Colossus, designed by Tommy
Flowers, became the world’s first programmable electronic digital
computer, used for cryptographic codebreaking. In the U.S., the ENIAC
was completed in 1945 by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert. It was one
of the first general-purpose electronic computers, though reprogramming
it required manual rewiring.

The invention of the integrated circuit (IC) further transformed
computing. Jack Kilby created the first working IC in 1958 at Texas
Instruments, and Robert Noyce independently developed a more scalable
version in 1959 at Fairchild Semiconductor using planar technology.
Integrated circuits enabled the development of microprocessors, personal
computers, and embedded systems, revolutionizing industries from
information technology to telecommunications.

Digital Logic

Binary & Other Number Systems

Computers operate on binary principles, but humans often use different
numbering systems that translate into these binary operations.
Understanding various number systems is fundamental to working with
computers and digital systems.

The Decimal System (Base-10)

The decimal system, also known as base-10, uses ten digits: 0 through 9.
It is the numbering system we use in everyday life because it aligns
with the way humans count using our fingers.

The Binary System

The binary system uses two digits: 0 and 1 (off and on). This is ideal
for digital systems because it corresponds directly to the physical
states of electronic components.

Counting in Binary

  Binary   Decimal
  -------- ---------
  0        0
  1        1
  10       2
  11       3
  100      4
  101      5
  110      6
  111      7
  1000     8
  1001     9
  1010     10
  1011     11
  1100     12
  1101     13
  1110     14
  1111     15

Converting Binary to Decimal

To convert a binary number to decimal, you add up the values of each bit
that is turned on (1). For example:

-   Binary 0001 (1 = 1 in decimal)

-   Binary 0010 (2 = 2 in decimal)

-   Binary 0011 (2 + 1 = 3 in decimal)

-   Binary 1010 (8 + 2 = 10 in decimal)

-   Binary 1111 (8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15 in decimal)

The Hexadecimal System (Base-16)

Hexadecimal, or “hex,” uses base-16 and includes digits from 0-9 and
letters A-F (or a-f), where A represents 10, B represents 11, up to F
representing 15.

Why Use Hexadecimal?

Hexadecimal is commonly used in computing because it provides a more
compact representation of binary data. Each hexadecimal digit
corresponds to four binary digits (a nibble), making it easier to work
with and read binary values.

Here are some examples of hexadecimal numbers along with their
corresponding binary and decimal values:

  Hexadecimal   Binary      Decimal
  ------------- ----------- ---------
                0000        0
  1             0001        1
  A             1010        10
  F             1111        15
  10            0001 0000   16
  FF            1111 1111   255
  8C            1000 1100   140

The Octal System (Base-8)

Octal, or “oct,” uses base-8 and includes digits from 0-7. It was
historically used in early computing systems but is less common today.

Why Use Octal?

Octal is useful for simplifying the representation of binary data into
smaller chunks. Each octal digit corresponds to three binary digits
(bits).

Example:

-   Binary: 001 010 110

-   Octal: 126

General Numbering System Overview

All numbering systems can be categorized by their base, which determines
the number of unique digits they use.

  Base   Name          Common Uses
  ------ ------------- -------------------------------------------
         Binary        The foundation of digital computing.
  8      Octal         Less common; used in older systems.
  10     Decimal       The standard numbering system for humans.
  16     Hexadecimal   Common in computing and electronics.

Why Different Numbering Systems?

Different numbering systems are used because:

1.  Efficiency: Binary is efficient for computers but less readable for
    humans.

2.  Readability: Hexadecimal and octal provide a more compact and
    human-readable format than binary.

3.  Legacy Systems: Some older systems relied on octal or decimal
    representations.

Logic Gates

What is a Logic Gate?

A logic gate is a fundamental building block of digital circuits. It
processes one or more input signals (binary values of 0 or 1) and
produces a single binary output based on specific rules defined by its
type. By combining them, you can create complex functions like adders,
multipliers, and even entire CPUs.

Basic Logic Gates

Here are truth tables for some of the fundamental types of logic gates:

1.  AND Gate: Outputs true only if both inputs are true.

  Input A   Input B   Output
  --------- --------- --------
            0         0
  0         1         0
  1         0         0
  1         1         1

1.  OR Gate: Outputs true if at least one input is true.

  Input A   Input B   Output
  --------- --------- --------
            0         0
  0         1         1
  1         0         1
  1         1         1

1.  NOT Gate: Inverts the input.

  Input   Output
  ------- --------
          1
  1       0

1.  NAND Gate: NOT AND.

  Input A   Input B   Output
  --------- --------- --------
            0         1
  0         1         1
  1         0         1
  1         1         0

1.  XOR Gate: Exclusive OR.

  Input A   Input B   Output (Y)
  --------- --------- ------------
            0         0
  0         1         1
  1         0         1
  1         1         0

Real-World Analogy

Think of an AND gate as a car’s ignition system, requiring both the key
and the brake pedal to be pressed before starting the engine.

Digital Circuits

Building Blocks

Digital circuits are constructed using logic gates. For example:

-   Half Adder: Adds two binary digits.

  Input A   Input B   Sum   Carry
  --------- --------- ----- -------
            0         0     0
  0         1         1     0
  1         0         1     0
  1         1         0     1

The construction of a half adder involves two fundamental logic gates:

1.  XOR (Exclusive OR) Gate: This gate calculates the sum (S) of the two
    binary inputs (A and B). The XOR gate outputs 1 when the inputs are
    different and 0 when they are the same.

2.  AND Gate: This gate determines the carry (C) output. It outputs 1
    only if both inputs (A and B) are 1, indicating that a carry is
    generated to the next higher bit.

Thus, a half adder consists of one XOR gate for the sum and one AND gate
for the carry.

The half-adder is essential because it forms the basis of more complex
arithmetic circuits. Without the ability to add binary digits, a
computer cannot perform basic arithmetic operations, which are
fundamental to nearly all computations.

Computing

Introduction to Computing

What is Computing?

Computing refers to the process of using computers to perform tasks that
range from simple calculations to complex problem-solving. It forms the
backbone of modern technology, enabling everything from personal
productivity to advanced scientific research.

Hardware and Software Components

At its core, a computer system comprises two main components:

-   Hardware: This includes the physical devices that make up the
    computer, such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage
    devices, and input/output peripherals like keyboards and monitors.

-   Software: This refers to the programs and instructions that tell the
    hardware what tasks to perform. Software can be categorized into
    system software (like operating systems) and application software
    (such as word processors or web browsers).

Types of Computers

Computers come in various forms, each designed for specific purposes:

-   Personal Computers (PCs): These are used by individuals for tasks
    like browsing the internet, writing documents, and gaming.

-   Laptops/Notebooks: Portable versions of PCs, ideal for on-the-go
    use.

-   Servers: Powerful computers that manage data and resources over
    networks, often used in web hosting or cloud services.

Central Processing Unit (CPU)

Introduction

-   The CPU is often referred to as the “brain” of the computer.

-   It processes instructions, performs calculations, and manages data
    flow between components.

-   Understanding the CPU is fundamental to understanding how computers
    work.

Key Components of a CPU

1.  Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

    -   Performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction,
        multiplication, division).

    -   Handles logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, etc.).

2.  Control Unit (CU)

    -   Manages the interpretation and execution of instructions.

    -   Coordinates activities between hardware components.

3.  Registers

    -   Temporary storage locations for data and instructions.

    -   Examples: Program Counter (PC), Instruction Register (IR),
        Accumulator.

4.  Cache Memory

    -   Small, fast memory used to store frequently accessed data or
        instructions.

    -   Reduces the time needed to access data from main memory.

5.  Clock Speed

    -   The speed at which the CPU processes instructions (measured in
        Hz or GHz).

    -   Higher clock speeds generally mean faster processing.

Clocks

The speed of a clock is measured in Hertz (Hz), which quantifies how
many cycles occur per second. Imagine it like the ticks of a clock—each
tick represents one cycle. Here’s a breakdown:

-   1 Hz (Hertz): One cycle per second.

-   1 kHz (KiloHertz): 1,000 Hz or 1,000 cycles per second.

-   1 MHz (MegaHertz): 1,000,000 Hz or one million cycles per second.

-   1 GHz (GigaHertz): 1,000,000,000 Hz or one billion cycles per
    second.

Functionality of the CPU

-   Fetch Cycle: Retrieves instructions from memory.

-   Decode Cycle: Interprets the retrieved instructions.

-   Execute Cycle: Processes the instructions (e.g., arithmetic
    operations, data movement).

-   Write Back Cycle: Stores results in memory or registers.

Types of CPUs

1.  CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing)

    -   Uses complex instructions that take more clock cycles to
        execute.

    -   Example: Early Intel x86 processors.

2.  RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)

Machine Code

Turing Machines and Their Relevance to Modern Computing

Before diving into machine code, it’s essential to understand the
theoretical underpinnings of computing. The concept of a Turing machine,
introduced by mathematician Alan Turing in 1936, forms the foundation of
modern computer science. While abstract, this model helps us comprehend
what it means for a machine to compute.

A Turing machine consists of:

-   An infinite strip of tape divided into cells, each capable of
    holding a symbol (like ‘0’ or ‘1’).

-   A read/write head that moves along the tape, reading symbols and
    writing new ones.

-   A set of rules governing the head’s actions based on the current
    state and the symbol it reads.

The machine operates in discrete steps: 1. The head reads the current
cell’s symbol. 2. Based on its current state and the symbol, the machine
follows a rule (e.g., write a symbol, move left/right). 3. The state
changes to reflect the operation performed.

Despite their simplicity, Turing machines can simulate any algorithm,
making them incredibly powerful. Modern computers operate based on
similar principles—processing data and following instructions
step-by-step.

Understanding Turing machines provides insight into why certain problems
are solvable by computers and how computational complexity impacts
performance. This theoretical framework bridges the gap between abstract
concepts and practical implementation, reinforcing why machine code
remains relevant in timeless computing applications.

def bubble_sort(arr): n = len(arr) for i in range(n): for j in range(0,
n-i-1): if arr[j] > arr[j+1]: arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j] return
arr

FPGAs

Introduction to FPGAs

What is an FPGA?

An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a type of integrated circuit
that can be configured by a user after manufacturing to perform specific
tasks. Unlike CPUs or GPUs, which are designed for general-purpose
computing, FPGAs are highly customizable and can be reprogrammed to suit
various applications.

Why Choose FPGAs?

    -   FPGAs: Highly flexible; can be reprogrammed to adapt to
        different tasks or evolving needs.

    -   ASICs: Fixed functionality once manufactured; not designed for
        changes after production.

2.  Performance:

    -   FPGAs: Slower due to their programmable nature, but versatile
        enough for multiple tasks.

    -   ASICs: Faster and more efficient as they are optimized for their
        specific task, often outperforming FPGAs in that area.

3.  Cost and Design Time:

    -   FPGAs: Cheaper and quicker to develop using pre-made chips and
        software tools, ideal for prototyping and varied applications.

    -   ASICs: More expensive and time-consuming due to custom hardware
        design and manufacturing (silicon fabrication), but costs are
        amortized over high volumes.

4.  Power Consumption:

    -   FPGAs: Sometimes use more power due to their programmable
        components.

    -   ASICs: Optimized for efficiency in their specific task, often
        using less power effectively.

        such as specialized tasks in networking or video processing.

Basic Layout of a Simple FPGA

An FPGA is an integrated circuit that can be configured by the user
after manufacturing to perform specific tasks. Unlike CPUs or GPUs,
which are designed for general-purpose computing, FPGAs are highly
customizable and can be reprogrammed to suit various applications.

Here’s a basic overview of the key components in an FPGA:

1.  Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs): These are the fundamental building
    blocks of an FPGA. CLBs contain Look-Up Tables (LUTs), which can be
    programmed to implement any logical function, such as AND gates, OR
    gates, or more complex functions.

2.  Flip-Flops: These are used for storing data and creating timing
    delays in the circuit.

3.  Block RAMs (BRAMs): These are small blocks of memory that can be
    used for storage within the FPGA.

4.  Multipliers: These are specialized hardwired circuits for performing
    multiplication operations, which are essential for
    arithmetic-intensive applications like digital signal processing or
    cryptography.

5.  I/O Blocks: These are input/output blocks that allow the FPGA to
    connect to external devices, such as LEDs, buttons, or other
    microcontrollers.

6.  Interconnects: These are the internal connections that route data
    between different parts of the FPGA. They can be programmed to
    create custom pathways for signals.

What Are Look-Up Tables (LUTs)?

A Look-Up Table (LUT) is a memory component within an FPGA’s
Configurable Logic Block (CLB). LUTs are used to implement logical
functions by storing the truth tables of those functions. For example:

-   A 4-LUT can store 16 possible input combinations (since (2^4 = 16))
    and their corresponding outputs.

-   When an input is applied to the LUT, it looks up the stored truth
    table to determine the correct output.

LUTs are highly flexible because they can be reprogrammed to implement
any logical function. For instance:

// Truth table for a 2-LUT implementing an XOR gate: input | output 0 |
1 1 | 0

// Verilog code for the same functionality: output = (input == 1) ? 0 :
1;

How Are LUTs Programmed?

LUTs are programmed by configuring their stored truth tables. This is
done through a configuration file that defines how each CLB should be
set up. The configuration file is generated using hardware description
languages like Verilog or VHDL, and it specifies the desired logical
operations for each part of the FPGA.

The programming process involves:

1.  Designing the Circuit: Using a hardware description language (e.g.,
    Verilog), you define how the circuit should behave.

2.  Synthesis: Tools like Yosys convert the high-level Verilog code into
    a netlist, which describes the logical connections between
    components.

3.  Place and Route: Nextpnr or other tools map the logical circuits to
    the physical layout of the FPGA, determining where each component
    will be placed and how signals will route through the interconnects.

4.  Configuration File Generation: The final configuration file (often
    in .bit or .sof format) is generated, which contains the specific
    instructions for configuring each LUT and other components within
    the FPGA.

5.  Programming the FPGA: The configuration file is loaded into the
    FPGA’s memory using a programmer (e.g., a JTAG cable).

Summary

FPGAs are highly flexible and programmable integrated circuits that can
be configured to perform a wide variety of tasks. LUTs are the core
components within FPGAs that store truth tables for logical functions,
and they are programmed by generating configuration files in hardware
description languages like Verilog or VHDL. By configuring these
components, users can create custom digital circuits tailored to their
specific needs.

Tools

HDL Synthesis

An HDL (Hardware Description Language) synthesis tool processes a
high-level descriptive code written in languages like Verilog or VHDL.
This tool converts the abstract behavioral description of a digital
circuit into a lower-level representation, such as a netlist, which
defines the logical gates and connections required to implement the
design on an FPGA. The synthesis tool optimizes the design for factors
like area, speed, and power consumption, ensuring efficient use of the
FPGA’s resources.

Place-and-Route

After the HDL synthesis, the place-and-route tool takes the generated
netlist and maps it onto the physical structure of the FPGA. This
involves two main steps:

1.  Placing: The tool determines the optimal positions for each
    component (like LUTs and flip-flops) on the FPGA chip to minimize
    delays and maximize efficiency.

2.  Routing: It then routes the connections between these components,
    ensuring that all necessary signals can travel without interference
    or excessive delay. This step is crucial for managing the complex
    web of interconnections within the FPGA.

Together, these tools transform a high-level design into a physically
realizable configuration on an FPGA, enabling the implementation of
custom digital circuits.

Verilog - Hardware Description Language

Introduction to Verilog

Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to describe
digital circuits. It allows you to design and simulate hardware
components, such as logic gates and microprocessors.

Simple Verilog Example

In this example we will blink an LED (Light Emitting Diode).

// LED blinking circuit module blinky ( input clock_10hz, output LED );

reg led = 0; wire clock;

assign clock = clock_10hz;

always @(posedge clock) begin led = ~led; end

assign LED = led;

endmodule

This code defines a module that toggles an LED on and off using a clock
input.

Building the Blinky Circuit

Tools Needed

-   An FPGA computer or FPGA development board.

-   Yosys: A HDL synthesis tool for converting Verilog code into a
    hardware description.

-   nextpnr: Maps the description onto the FPGA chip.

You will also need a bitstream database and tools for the FPGA you’re
using, for example:

-   Project IceStorm (ICE40)

-   Project Trellis (ECP5)

-   Project X-Ray (XC7)

-   Project Peppercorn (CCGM1)

Building and Programming the Blinky Circuit

Here’s how you might program an FPGA to blink an LED:

1.  Define the Circuit:

    -   As we did above, use Verilog to describe a simple oscillator
        circuit that toggles an output signal at regular intervals.

2.  Synthesize and Configure:

    -   Convert the Verilog code into a configuration file using
        synthesis tools.

3.  Program the FPGA:

    -   Load the configuration file onto the FPGA board using
        programming software.

4.  Test the Circuit:

    -   Connect an LED to the specified output pin and power on the
        board. The LED should start blinking according to the programmed
        oscillator frequency.

System-On-Chip (SOC)

What is a SOC?

A System-on-Chip (or System-on-a-Chip) integrates various components,
like a CPU, memory, and peripherals, onto a single chip. FPGAs allow
creating custom SOCs tailored to specific applications, as well as
general-purpose applications, such as computing.

Comparing ASIC SOCs and FPGA SOCs

1.  Performance Constraints: Generally slower than ASICs due to
    implementation on the FPGA fabric.

FPGA Computing

FPGAs can implement different computer architectures. By configuring the
FPGA’s logic blocks, you can create a virtual version of any CPU or
computer system. For example:

-   NES (Nintendo Entertainment System): The 6502 CPU used in the NES
    can be emulated by programming specific logic blocks within the FPGA
    to replicate its behavior.

-   Apple II: Similarly, the Apple II’s architecture can be recreated,
    allowing you to run classic Apple II software on an FPGA-based
    system.

-   Amiga: The Motorola 68000 CPU used in Amiga systems can also be
    emulated, preserving the classic Amiga experience.

-   RISC-V: This modern instruction set can be implemented in an FPGA,
    enabling a new system that leverages RISC-V’s efficiency and
    scalability and providing an environment for running Linux.

    operating system tailored for timeless applications. Its simplicity
    makes it easier to understand, audit, and control—perfect for users
    who want a distraction-free environment focused on specific tasks
    like reading, writing, or education.

Customization for Timeless Computing

-   Linux is designed to be a general-purpose OS that can run a wide
    variety of applications. While this is great for versatility, it
    often introduces unnecessary complexity and resource overhead for
    users who only need basic functionality.

-   Zeitlos is built specifically for FPGA-based computers and their
    unique strengths (like reconfigurable hardware). It’s optimized for
    timeless computing use cases, such as:

    -   Running lightweight, distraction-free applications.

    -   Supporting retro or custom computing environments.

    -   Providing a stable, secure platform that’s resistant to
        bloatware or unnecessary updates.

Longevity and Future-Proofing

-   Linux (and most modern operating systems) are designed with the
    assumption of constant evolution and improvement. While this is
    great for innovation, it can also lead to compatibility issues over
    time as hardware and software evolve.

-   Zeitlos aims to create a system that’s not just modern but also
    timeless—designed to remain relevant and functional for decades. Its
    modular design allows for incremental improvements while maintaining
    backward compatibility with classic computing paradigms.

Security Through Simplicity

    Complexity introduces potential vulnerabilities and makes it harder
    to audit the system for security flaws.

-   Zeitlos is designed with a focus on simplicity and minimalism, which
    reduces the attack surface and makes the system easier to secure.
    Its single-user design (with optional multitasking) also eliminates
    many of the risks associated with multi-user systems.

Hardware-Aware Design

    of devices. However, this flexibility often requires compromises in
    performance or resource usage.

-   Zeitlos is built specifically for FPGA-based hardware and takes full
    advantage of the unique capabilities of these systems (e.g.,
    reconfigurable logic, low-power operation). This hardware-aware
    design allows for optimizations that wouldn’t be possible with a
    one-size-fits-all OS like Linux.

Retrocomputing and Customization

-   While Linux can run emulators and support classic computing
    environments, it often does so in a way that feels layered and
    indirect.

-   Zeitlos aims to recreate the magic of retro systems (like the Amiga
    or Macintosh) while adding modern capabilities. Its design borrows
    from the best ideas of classic computers, making it feel familiar
    and approachable for users who love retrocomputing or want to
    experiment with custom hardware.

Long-Term Vision

-   Linux is a fantastic choice for general-purpose computing, but it’s
    not designed with the same long-term goals as Machdyne. Our goal is
    to create systems that will remain useful and relevant for
    decades—even in scenarios where modern technology might fail or
    become inaccessible (e.g., in a survival computing context).

-   Zeitlos is part of this vision, offering a lightweight, secure, and
    customizable platform that can evolve alongside timeless hardware.

Conclusion

Linux (and Kakao Linux) will continue to play a role in our ecosystem
for users who want the best of both worlds: the simplicity of FPGA
hardware paired with the power of a modern OS.
